# LED_Matrix
This repository includes designing a robot mouth using an 8x8 LED Matrix. I designed two expressions one for the smiley face and the other for talking to solve the problem of the interactivity to the robot.



Step one:

Design the robot mouth using the 8x8 LED Matrix.  



Step two:

Write the code to display each expression.



Step three:

LED Matrix Connections:

1-The GND in the LED Matrix is to the GND in the Arduino board.

2-The VCC in LED Matrix is to the 5V in the Arduino board.

3-The DIN in LED Matrix is to Pin 12 in the Arduino board.

4-The CS in LED Matrix is to Pin 11 in the Arduino board.

5-The CLK in LED Matrix is to Pin 10 in the Arduino board.

output:
