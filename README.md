# LED_Matrix
This repository includes designing a robot mouth using an 8x8 LED Matrix. I designed two expressions one for the smiley face and the other for talking to solve the problem of the interactivity to the robot.

Step one:
Design the robot mouth using the 8x8 LED Matrix.  

Step two:
Write the code to display each expression.



Step three:
LED Matrix Connections:
1-The GND in the LED Matrix is to the GND in the Arduino board. 
2-The VCC in LED Matrix is to the 5V in the Arduino board.
3-The DIN in LED Matrix is to Pin 12 in the Arduino board.
4-The CS in LED Matrix is to Pin 11 in the Arduino board.
5-The CLK in LED Matrix is to Pin 10 in the Arduino board.
